* 👾 Code whisperer who makes APIs run faster than my morning coffee kicks in! 
* Backend wizard (Go + Azure) by day, desk-organizer by night.
* 🚀 Tamed a 50TB data beast with Go - Zmanda Pro Oracle backups are faster than your internet speed!
* 🤖 Built a chatbot with LangChain, OpenAI, and QDRANT, so smart it now answers questions I haven't even asked yet xD.
* My Docker containers are more organized than my life, and my microservices architecture is the only relationship I can commit to.
